      <description>Life is full of compromises.
When venturing for a new apartment, I found a two bedroom one in an area I liked. The cupboards, however, were white, flat, and without character.
Boring.
For anyone who knows me, I am far from boring and always find ways to make life interesting.
With a little nudge of inspiration from my girlfriend, Anna, what I saw in front of me instead was a blank canvas.</description>

      <description>Anna,
What has become a year has felt like a lifetime.
Coming from broken relationships, we discovered what real, effortless, love really is. As you have said, we&amp;rsquo;re like puzzle pieces that, through wear and tear, have been warped into pieces that now fit together.
You have reignited my love for crafting, fully realized my passion for music by exposing me to live entertainment, and you pick up the controller to help me beat bosses when Iâ€™m gaming.</description>
