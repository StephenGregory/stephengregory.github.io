<p>Life is full of compromises.</p>

<p>When venturing for a new apartment, I found a two bedroom one in an area I liked. The cupboards, however, were white,
flat, and without character.</p>

<p><strong>Boring.</strong></p>

<p>For anyone who <em>knows</em> me, I am far from boring and always find ways to make life interesting.</p>

<p>With a little nudge of inspiration from my girlfriend, Anna, what I saw in front of me instead was a blank canvas.</p>

<p>Over the next few months I got to work and played with ideas, off and on, until I had something that I was satisfied with.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Before I get into the details, what is below is the final product on the first panel of what will be a full kitchen
piece.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/full.jpg" alt="Full" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/cupboard-final.jpg" alt="Cupboard" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/drawers-final.jpg" alt="Drawers" /></p>

<p>Music is a huge part of my life. While not musically inclined myself, I find great joy in hearing what others create.
There&rsquo;s something comforting about being able to associate your current mood and feelings with a sound. It can transport
yourself mentally. As it is ubiquitous in my life, I chose it as the theme for my cupboards.</p>

<p>The intricate stories from <a href="www.wearetheburninghell.com">The Burning Hell</a> typically take abrupt, humorously
depressing turns. <a href="http://www.blimprockenterprises.com/">Blimp Rock</a>&rsquo;s songs pay a similar attention to detail
to their lyrics, having a familiar quirk to their music.</p>

<p>As I feel both bands have a similar quirk, I thought it was fitting to combine them in one art piece. This piece
incorporates images from <a href="https://theburninghell.bandcamp.com/track/i-love-the-things-that-people-make">I Love The Things That People Make</a>,
lyrics from <a href="https://theburninghell.bandcamp.com/track/the-things-that-people-make-pt-2">The Things That People Make, Pt. 2</a>
(one of my favorite Burning Hell songs), and images from Blimp Rock.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Cheap.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m living in apartment and have a tendency to move every couple of years. Whatever I create will be custom and
temporary.</p></li>

<li><p>Non-destructive.</p>

<p>The apartment cannot be damaged in any way and no residue can be left behind.</p></li>

<li><p>Meaningful.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-artists">The artists</h2>

<p>Over the past couple of years my music taste has found a home in indie music. Not only does it appeal to me audibly,
but I prefer small venue shows as opposed to stadium shows. It&rsquo;s a much more intimate experience when dancing away
to a band&rsquo;s tunes when they&rsquo;re not a speck on the horizon.</p>

<p>I met Mathias and Ariel before a show in February 2016, without realizing they were in The Burning Hell. It was a
Valentine&rsquo;s Day gig, where they played songs from
<a href="https://theburninghell.bandcamp.com/album/dont-believe-the-hyperreal">Don&rsquo;t Believe The Hyperreal</a>. Their timing was
spot-on, graciously allowing the crowd to breath catch their breath between laughter (read: frequent side workouts).</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/the-burning-hell-ship.jpg" alt="The Burning Hell - The Ship Pub - 2016" /></p>

<p>I came across and met Blimp Rock at Lawnya Vawnya 2016, a 5 day indie music festival in St. John&rsquo;s, Newfoundland. Anna
initiated the entire crowd sitting down on the floor of The Ship with Peter Demakos for Sensitive Boys. You only live
once, as they say.</p>

 </div>


<p>Off stage they are also a kind and fun group. Knowing that makes listening to their music even more enjoyable.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p>I experimented with a few different combinations of this process, but what follows is what gave me the best results.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Design.</p>

<p>Completed in Photoshop. I measured my drawers and cupboard and created canvases accordingly. It was more cost
effective to print it out on multiple pages, so I chose a background with a gradient and noise so the joins
would be less noticeable.</p></li>

<li><p>Print.</p>

<p>Printed at Staples. I split the cupboard design into 3 11x17&rdquo; segments.</p></li>

<li><p>Coat with spray.</p>

<p>To prevent ink from bleeding when applying the prints to the Con-Tact paper (next step), I applied 6 coats to <strong>both</strong>
sides. In my experimentation, I found that both sides were necessary. The can recommends 4-5 coats, but I found 6
worked best.</p>

<p>I taped my prints to foam boards with some painter&rsquo;s tape I had lying around (to prevent warping) and sprayed them
in a well ventilated space.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/spray-prep.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>During the first spray I mistakenly hung the boards up, leading to some
ink running.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/spray.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the remainder I kept the boards laying flat on some chairs (no pictures of this).</p></li>

<li><p>Adhere to Con-Tact paper</p>

<p>I taped the Con-Tact paper to a surface so it did not warp when drying. Following this, I covered the surface in
liquid mod podge and then the back of the piece. I then laid the piece atop of the paper and used my handy-dandy
Memorial University ID card on a 45 degree angle to press the piece the paper. Starting from the center
and pushing outward was the routine that worked best. I started with low pressure until I worked through the
entire piece and then increased the pressure on subsequent rounds until all air bubbles were removed. I left it alone
until dried (~30 minutes).</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/adhere-to-white.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>

<li><p>Cover with clear Con-Tact paper</p>

<p>I wanted to protect the piece in the event of spills, so I covered it in clear Con-Tact (using a card to remove
bubbles). It adds some fogginess to the piece, but from afar you can&rsquo;t really notice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/clear-cover.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>

<li><p>Apply to final destination</p>

<p>I removed any hardware and then cleaned the surface of any dirt and grease that would prevent the paper from sticking.</p>

<p>I removed the backing from the Con-Tact paper, lined it up on my surface, and patted it down with my fingers in a
few areas so it wouldn&rsquo;t move. I then took my card to it to flatten it down. I found that this part
was much more forgiving when removing air bubbles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/drawer.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I poked a hole through the hardware holes with a pin, used a sharp knife to cut an &ldquo;x&rdquo; into the pin hole, and
pushed the screws through and put on hardware.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/pin.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/drawer-complete.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a few hours/days, I noticed some edges peeling off. I applied packing tape along the edges. It doesn&rsquo;t stand
out as much as I had thought.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Mod Podge Matte 8 oz - $9.97</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/mod-podge.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/acrylic-sealer.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>

<li><p>White Con-Tact Paper - 18&rdquo; x 24&rsquo; - ~$8.00</p></li>

<li><p>Printed designs - 7 x 11x17&rdquo; @ $0.89 - $6.23</p></li>

<li><p>Foam board - 2 @ $1.50 - $3.00</p></li>

<li><p>3 Piece Foam Brush Set - 2&rdquo; &amp; 3&rdquo; - $1.25</p>

<p><img src="/images/cupboards/burning-hell-blimp-rock/foam-brush.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Total: $46.42 (before tax).</p>

<h3 id="what-s-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h3>

<p>I still have more canvas to work with! So I&rsquo;m getting to work on extending this with other artists who produce
music with a special significance to me (<a href="catltheband.com">catl</a>, <a href="http://www.julytalk.com/">July Talk</a>,
<a href="www.arkellsmusic.com/">Arkells</a>, <a href="https://saidthewhale.com/">Said The Whale</a>, and more!).</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
